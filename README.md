# SCADA-IDS
üîê Final Year Project ‚Äì Intrusion Detection in SCADA Systems
For my final year project, I developed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for SCADA environments using a combination of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The project, titled ‚ÄúA Combinational Approach for Intrusion Detection against Cyber Attacks in SCADA using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models,‚Äù aimed to enhance the detection of threats in critical infrastructure.

I experimented with models like AdaBoost, XGBoost, GRU+LSTM, and GRU+BILSTM, achieving up to 89% accuracy with the GRU-BILSTM model. 
Dataset used : UNR-IDD dataset.
simulating real-world attack scenarios: DoS, MitM, and SQL Injection.

This project reflects my passion for applying AI in cybersecurity and my drive to protect industrial systems against modern cyber threats.
